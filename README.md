## Node Watermark

Example of how to create watermark on NodeJS
It's only test example, strongly not recommended to use in production.

## Requirements

For development, you will need Node.js installed on your environement. Also, you will need install this deps: [Canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) and [Sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) (instructions for installation you can find on this links).

## Development 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/phyxolog/node-wm.git # or clone your own fork
cd node-wm
npm install # if error - look a "Requirements" section
# then copy in this folder some image with name "image.jpg"
node index.js
```
